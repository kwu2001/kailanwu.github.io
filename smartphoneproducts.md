In this WOD, the task was basically to use variables to eliminate hard-coding the information for displaying products, as well as to separate the product data from the rest of the code to make it easier to maintain and change. For more information about this WOD, you can refer to this link: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html

My experience for this WOD was pretty smooth, because I didn't find it hard to separate the product data from the rest of the code. There were three main steps that you had to do. The first step was to add the variables they provided for you to the <head> to serve as a product data. This part slowed me down a bit because I forgot to put a script tag, which was dumb of me. Then, in the second second you basically replace the element tags with your script. Finally, the last step was to create a new javascript file to link it with your html file and cut and paste all the variable declarations from the <head> into this new file. 

Like always, what I did to prepare for this WOD and any other WOD, was to read over all the instructions and tasks to make sure you understand what its asking you to do. However, next time I could have wrote down comments and steps as a guide for me to be better prepared as I do this WOD.
