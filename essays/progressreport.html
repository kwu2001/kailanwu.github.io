  <p>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways: Through the course of my programming journey, Labs, WODs, and especially Assignment 1, have been instrumental in shaping and honing my technical skills. Labs served as the playground where I could experiment with various HTML tags, understand their functionalities, and witness firsthand how they structure the content of a webpage. in addition, WODs, ranging from creating basic web pages to more complex layouts, allowed me to apply this knowledge on Assignment 1. My experience on Assignment 1 was tough, but it solidified my grasp of HTML’s structure and semantics, enabling me to craft well-organized and visually appealing web content.</p>

<p>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills: As I am still learning more about programming, I find myself struggling the most with debugging codes. Debugging codes is crucial because it ensures that a program functions as intended. It resolves errors, glitches, and unexpected behaviors that might impede the software’s operation. By narrowing down the scope of the issue and dividing the code into smaller sections and testing each component independently, will help me pinpoint the precise location or conditions triggering the bug, making it easier to fix.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast: Sometimes I do watch the screencast because I don’t know what to do, or the instructions are confusing. However, the WODs are super helpfull in learning how to create basic webpages. I can say with confidence that I can now complete WODs without copying from the screencast.</p>

<p>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence: As mentioned before, the labs served as the playground where I could experiment with various HTML tags, understand their functionalities, and witness firsthand how they structure the content of a webpage. Fortunately, professor Sal also offers us lecture videos with explanation on how to do the Labs which helps a lot in understanding the concept of the assignment.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2: Completing assignment 1 was very challenging, but I think since I have already built the foundation of my website I don’t think assignment 2 should be that difficult. Plus I have been receving lots of help from my professor which gives me an extra boost of confidence.</p>

<p>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways: I think the class can be improved to help our learning if there were group projects in the Assignments. I think we can learn from each other’s experiences and gain insights that might not have been possible in a solitary learning environment. In addition resolving issues together that requires problem solving skills is a valuable ability in both academic and professional contexts.</p>

<p>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.): So far, what helped me the most in class are the Labs, WODs, and screecasts. it acted as the proving ground where I could delve into concepts like variables, loops, and functions. These tasks also pushed me to think algorithmically, solving problems by writing scripts that manipulated the webpage’s behavior based on user interactions. From basic functionalities like form validation to more complex tasks involving DOM manipulation,</p>
