  <p>To my surprise BrowserHistory1 was fairly easy, even though it was my longest screen cast(18 minutees, 55 seconds), but it only took me 3 tries to finish. Most of the tags used can be searched up online, I used the W3Schools. The only hard and time consuming part was creating a table of contents and create an itemized list with links for each of the sections, because it involves a lot of typing.</p>

<p>BrowserHistory2 was the hardest for me and took the most attempts(5) because it invovled css. IT was also the WOD that I actually had to prepare and do some reasearch beforehand because I was not familiar with a lot of the commands. However, W3Schools provided me with a lot of information that I was able to make use of. I finished this WOD in 8 minutes</p>

<p>After familiarizing myself with css, the last WOD, BrowserHistory3 was the easiest. It only took me 2 tries and I was able to finish it in 7 minutes and 15 seconds. The only part I had a hard time with was centering the heading, image, and paragraph. For some reason I wasn’t able to get the Chrome to stay in the center. But with some research I was able to figure out the padding.</p>

<p>My only advice for doing the WODs is to read over the instructions so that you can prepare yourself before you do the screencast. Even if you fail, you should keep trying, this will allow you to challenge yourself. If you feel like you’re completely stuck and have no clue what your doing, then ask others for help.</p>
